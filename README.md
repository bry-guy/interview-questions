## What is this?

I've created, and am collecting, questions that can help me interview more successfully for software dev jobs. These are mostly verbal communications questions, rather than Leetcode questions.

## Style of Answers

The answers I've included here are _rough_, on purpose. My goal is to loosely organize my thoughts, and to make it easy to demonstrate the kind of interview I can actually give, rather than some highly-polished set of answers that I couldn't really give you in real life.
